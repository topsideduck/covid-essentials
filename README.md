# COVID Essentials
 
## Inspiration: 
With the pandemic rampaging the world, we wanted to make it easier for us Indians to navigate through statistics and news for Covid 19. 

## What does it do? 
It is pretty simple concept, but we aimed to make a all in one website for covid related information and this can save tons of time compared to how its done normally .With a clean table for all important covid statistics navigating through them for yuor respective state is as easy as cutting butter. Along with this we have integrated a chatbot into the website which can reply to your covid doubts with the help of AI. 

## How we built it:
Our website was built Python and TensorFlow for the chatbot and and we used HTML , CSS and JS to integrate it all into a single website. 

## Accomplishments:
 We are proud that we could do something that will help the world in the short amount of time we were given.
